- ✅ Five-event pattern:
  - One kind 31990 (handler info declaring support for 9901, 9902, 9903, 9904)
  - One kind 31989 with `d:"9901"` (recommendation for reservation.request)
  - One kind 31989 with `d:"9902"` (recommendation for reservation.response)
  - One kind 31989 with `d:"9903"` (recommendation for reservation.modification.request)
  - One kind 31989 with `d:"9904"` (recommendation for reservation.modification.response)
- ✅ NIP-09 deletion events for cleanup
- ✅ Full test coverage
- 📍 Located: `client/src/lib/handlerEvents.ts`
- 📍 Integration: `client/src/components/BusinessProfileForm.tsx`

## 🔧 Partially Implemented

### NIP-13 Proof of Work
- ✅ Library implemented with full mining logic
- ✅ Difficulty calculation and validation
- ✅ Test coverage
- ❌ **Not enforced on outgoing messages**
- ❌ **Not validated on incoming messages**
- 📍 Located: `client/src/lib/nip13.ts`
- 📅 **Will be enforced in Phase 2**

## 📅 Planned (Phase 2 - Calendar Integration)

### NIP-40 Expiration Timestamps
- Auto-expire old reservation proposals
- Time-bound holds
- Cleanup of expired threads

### NIP-52 Calendar Events
- **Kind 31923**: Time-Based Calendar Event

### Complete Reservation Flow
1. AI Concierge → Restaurant: Request (9901)
2. Restaurant → Concierge: Response (9902) - Suggested alternative time
3. AI Concierge → Restaurant: Modification Request (9903) - Accepts modification
4. Restaurant → Concierge: Modification Response (9904) - Confirms
5. Restaurant → Concierge: Calendar event (31923) - [Phase 2]
